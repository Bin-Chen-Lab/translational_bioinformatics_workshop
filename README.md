+ Network (igraph, cytoscape, stringdb, KEGG)  
+ Unstructured data (text, clinical note, pattern regular expression)  
2. Data modality  
+ Omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)  
+ Screening data (CRISPR, pharmacogenomics)  
+ Image data (Morphology image)  
+ Knowledge graph (PPI)  
+ EMR 
3. Models
+ cells/organoids/animal models/patients  
4. Public data resources  
5. Basic R (read/write, data types)  
6. Workshop structure
